> SCRIPTS

This directory contains scripts for JEB clients. It comes with a set of sample
scripts publicly available on our GitHub repository, here:
https://github.com/pnfsoftware/jeb2-samplecode/tree/master/scripts

Scripts should not be confused with plugins, although they use the same JEB API.

JEB scripts are run using Jython, a 2.7 implementation of Python in Java.
Refer to https://www.jython.org/ for additional information about Jython,
as well as its limitations.

The JEB UI desktop client as well as command-line clients can run JEB scripts.

How to use:
- Within the UI client: scripts can be executed via the 'File/Scripts/...'
  menu command.
- On the command-line: full clients may execute scripts using command lines like:
  $ jeb_macos.sh -c --srv2 --script=<path> ...
  Refer to your start-up script (eg, jeb_wincon.bat) help page for more details.
- Scripts should not be used for heavy-lifting operations. They are meant to
  execute small tasks within a the context of a JEB client. 
- Note that current JEB scripts significantly differ from JEB1 scripts. Refer to
  JEB Developer Portal for tutorials and API documentation:
